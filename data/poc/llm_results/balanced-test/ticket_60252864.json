    "reasoning": "ATLAS initially misunderstood the customer\u2019s intent (licensing vs technical support) but then corrected course and asked for more details. There is no clear, demonstrably incorrect guidance or broken promises captured in the transcript, and the customer did not complain about AI accuracy.",

    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly indicated the bot was insufficient and sought additional (human) assistance. After escalation to L1, the customer continued repeatedly re-engaging with multiple messages (\u201cHi/Hello/Anyone there\u201d) without progress, which reflects a practical wall/loop experience from their perspective.",

    "reasoning": "When the agent finally responded, they reflected the customer\u2019s situation (expired license, company name, service impact) and used the license key already provided rather than re-asking for it. No clear evidence shows the agent ignored previously provided information or forced the customer to repeat details.",
    "evidence": [
