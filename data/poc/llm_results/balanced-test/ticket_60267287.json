    "reasoning": "The only clear AI involvement shown is the initial ATLAS chat prompting for license eligibility. There is no explicit evidence that the AI provided demonstrably incorrect technical guidance or that the customer complained about AI accuracy. Most substantive troubleshooting guidance in the thread appears to be provided by human agents.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer did not ask to speak with a human, did not express frustration about AI handling the issue, and there is no clear 3+ repetition loop from AI responses. The conversation transitions quickly into human-led troubleshooting steps and log review.",

    "reasoning": "After logs indicated a PST import crash tied to Outlook/MAPI/Redemption (0x800401FA), support provided a KB and steps related to MAIS Pickup .Q/.BIN processing hangs, which does not match the stated failure mode. An internal note explicitly acknowledges the mismatch, indicating the provided guidance did not properly reflect the evidence in the logs.",

      "The exact error sequence when trying to add a PST file: ... System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x800401FA): Wrong OS or OS version for application",
