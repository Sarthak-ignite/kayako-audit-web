    "reasoning": "ATLAS provided a plausible troubleshooting interpretation and a concrete workaround (Custom Software Deployment) tailored to the customer\u2019s scenario (CUs failing, other patches succeed, manual install works). There is no clear contradiction with ticket facts, no broken promises, and no customer complaint about incorrect/low-quality AI guidance.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI response is repeated twice in theme (same workaround), but not to the level of a 3+ repetition loop, and the customer did not ask for a human/escalation or express frustration specifically about AI.

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS acknowledges and incorporates the key context the customer provided (manual install works, other patches succeed, impacts multiple machines), rather than re-asking for the same information or pushing a path already ruled out.
