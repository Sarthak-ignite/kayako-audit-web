  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated guidance appears relevant to the reported blank licensing screen and focuses on supported activation paths (including emergency/manual activation) and required diagnostics. The customer did not complain that the AI guidance was wrong or misleading, and the ticket ultimately progressed to a concrete root cause and resolution.",
    "evidence": [
      "For Emergency License Activation (manual/offline), please follow these instructions within DNN:",
      "Your servers need to reach only the licensing endpoint https://dnnapi.com over HTTPS (port 443, TLS 1.2). Viewing a blank page at this URL in a browser is typical, as it is an API."
    ]
  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly requested a live meeting and escalation due to being blocked (blank licensing page) and inability to proceed. This meets the criteria for needing a human/technician and indicates the AI/self-serve flow was insufficient for the situation.",
    "evidence": [
      "thank you for this reply. Maybe we should have a meeting? On Zoom or Teams?",
      "We can't see existing licenses, we can't do anything.",
      "Also, I think we need to escalate this issue. I can't click the escalate button though, it's greyed out."
    ]
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the customer stated they had checked logs and confirmed connectivity to dnnapi.com, support\u2019s subsequent requests (HAR/console output/server logs) were additional, distinct artifacts needed to diagnose a client-side/UI loading issue. There is not clear evidence that agents repeatedly asked for the same information already provided or ignored decisive context.",
    "evidence": [
      "And we've proved we can hit https://dnnapi.com, no problem.",
      "I want to add that I inspected the lognet logs... and there was no records of exceptions in there for this.",
      "please provide us with the following information captured while attempting to Activate the License Manually: * HAR Capture (HTTP Archive)... * Browser Console Output..."
    ]
  },
  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly asked when they would receive help and sought assurance before a firm licensing deadline, indicating they were waiting on support action. The timeline shows a gap of over 24 hours between the customer\u2019s escalation/urgency messages (Oct 10\u201311) and the next substantive agent response (Oct 11 22:12 UTC).",
    "evidence": [
      "When can expect actual help with this issue?",
      "We know the deadline.   Can you guarantee you'll help us before the night of October 14?",
      "[2025-10-10T18:01:46+00:00] ... Maybe we should have a meeting? On Zoom or Teams?",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket was closed after the customer confirmed success (temporary licenses installed, \u201cAll is well\u201d) and later expressed appreciation. There is no indication the final customer message reflected an unresolved problem at closure time.",
    "evidence": [
      "Support, Sateesh and I installed the temporary licenses tonight. All is well.",
      "Thank you, you guys were great!"
    ]
  },
  "P1_SEV1_MISHANDLING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the customer expressed urgency due to an impending license expiry date, the ticket was not explicitly labeled P1/SEV1/critical and did not describe a complete outage. Support engaged with troubleshooting and ultimately resolved the issue before expiry, so clear P1/SEV1 mishandling is not evidenced.",
    "evidence": [
      "Guys, our current DNN licenses expire on Tuesday night at 11 pm, October 14, 2025.",
      "But we are distressed, because we have no method of installing these licenses come Tuesday, Oct 14."
