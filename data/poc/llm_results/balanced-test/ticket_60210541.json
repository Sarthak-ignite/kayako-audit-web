  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The initial AI response stayed at a generic \u201clikely firewall/routing\u201d diagnosis and recommended standard port/NAT checks without addressing the customer\u2019s core point: the issue appears only after upgrading to v10 and disappears after downgrading with no config changes. The customer explicitly indicated the guidance was not relevant to what they reported, signaling the AI response was not helpful for the actual scenario.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"all those steps are not to the point as update to v10 brakes it, downgrade to 9.5p3 fixes it. there are no config changes at all. Only version is chaning.\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear loop of repeated AI responses (3+ repetitions), and the customer did not request a human or escalation due to AI handling. After the initial AI reply, a human agent later engaged and progressed the ticket.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer stated they already disabled IPS/GeoIP/AV/AppFilter and the problem still occurred, but the AI response suggested steps in the same direction (disabling/excluding inspection/filtering) rather than engaging with the key differential: v10 vs 9.5 SP3 with unchanged configuration. This indicates the response did not sufficiently incorporate the provided troubleshooting context.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"the problem also occurred with all ips/geoip/antivirus/appfilter disabled.\"",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "After the customer pushed back on Sep 30, the next support reply in the ticket appears only on Oct 31, indicating an extended gap in agent follow-up. Even without an explicit customer complaint, a month-long silence during an unresolved technical report would typically be flagged by a quality reviewer as a significant response delay.",
