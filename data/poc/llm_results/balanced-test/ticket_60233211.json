    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI transcript appears to be tied to a different end user name than the ticket\u2019s stated customer, indicating a clear identity/context mismatch. This is a material quality issue because it suggests the assistant may be operating on (or logging) the wrong customer context.",
