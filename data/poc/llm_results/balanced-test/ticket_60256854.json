    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear evidence the AI provided incorrect or misleading guidance within the available excerpt. The AI\u2019s explanation about server vs. agent update timing is plausible and the customer did not challenge the accuracy or report a bad outcome in this ticket log.",

      "Customer (Mary Long): \"Completed successfully! I ran the diagnostics on the same computer and they were still outdated but the dowload for the updates was today's date.\"",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer did not ask for a human/technician or express frustration about AI support. The interaction shown is a single, forward-moving exchange rather than repetitive looping.",

    "reasoning": "The AI appears to respond directly to the customer\u2019s described state (server updates dated today, agent diagnostics still outdated) rather than requesting already-provided information or repeating ruled-out steps. No evidence shows the customer had to restate details due to support not reading the message.",
