    "reasoning": "The customer asked a specific process/status question about why a prior chat ticket was closed without any human response.

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly highlights that they have not had a conversation with a human agent and is questioning closure without human interaction, which is a clear signal they want/expect escalation to a person. Even without multiple turns, this reflects frustration with not reaching a human.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI did not engage with the context of the customer\u2019s question (ticket closure and lack of human contact) and instead pivoted to license information. This is a direct mismatch to the customer\u2019s stated issue and indicates the provided context was not used.",
