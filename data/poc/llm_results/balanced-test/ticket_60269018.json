    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support\u2019s final guidance (\u201ctest-triggered incident\u201d and patch downloads should now work) is unusual, but it is consistent with the engineering-side summary indicating it was not a real product defect. There is no explicit customer follow-up showing the guidance was wrong or unhelpful, and no broken promise is evident in the ticket text.",
    "evidence": [
      "GHI Engineering - 16301 // AlterPKC commented: Triggered from a test ticket. Closing",
      "GHI Engineering - 16301 // trilogy-taro[bot] commented: The root cause is identified as a test-triggered issue rather than a genuine product defect.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer requested a human/technician beyond normal help, nor any sign of repeated, looping responses. The interaction is short with two substantive support updates.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did not ask the customer to repeat information already provided and did not pursue a troubleshooting step the customer had already ruled out. The responses align with escalation/engineering review rather than redundant questioning.",

    "reasoning": "The customer did not post any follow-up indicating the issue remained unresolved at the time of solving/closure. While the customer also did not explicitly confirm resolution, the ticket shows no further customer engagement after the resolution message, so premature closure is not clearly evidenced.",
