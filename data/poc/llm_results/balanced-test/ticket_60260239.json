{
  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI response ultimately provided a reasonable path to fulfill a license request (requesting an authorization form and license/server details). While the earlier prompt about uploading logs/screenshots was not well-tailored to a licensing request, it is not clearly wrong or materially harmful given the follow-up instructions.",
    "evidence": [
      "If you have any \ud83d\udcc3 log files or \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f screenshots to upload to help with the troubleshooting, now is the time to do it \ud83d\udcaa",
      "Thank you for reaching out regarding your request for a new G2 license. To process your request efficiently, we kindly ask you to provide the following information: - Completed authorization form with all license details."
    ]
  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer asked for a human/technician, expressed frustration with AI, or experienced a repeating loop of the same guidance multiple times. The interaction shows a single AI request for information followed by internal handling and fulfillment.",
    "evidence": [
      "I want to request new g2 license"
    ]
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did not repeatedly ask for information that was already clearly provided, and there is no customer complaint that the team failed to read prior messages. The customer provided the key license request details and the team proceeded toward approval and issuance.",
    "evidence": [
      "G2-2023 Standard 32bit License request\nPlease issue it by January 7, 2026.",
      "As requested, please find the license attached."
    ]
  },
  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There was a long gap between the customer's provision of key request details (Dec 10) and the first customer-facing fulfillment response with the license (Dec 29). Even without an explicit complaint, a reasonable reviewer would flag the extended silence on a time-bound license request.",
    "evidence": [
      "[2025-12-10T06:23:05+00:00] ... \"Please issue it by January 7, 2026.\"",
      "[2025-12-29T04:58:26+00:00] \"As requested, please find the license attached.\"",
      "[2025-12-25T13:49:42+00:00] \"We have received a request for a new Gensym license under ticket 60260239... Kindly confirm whether the request for Perpetual license creation is approved.\""

  },
  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket was marked completed after the license was delivered, and there is no subsequent customer message indicating the issue remained unresolved. The closing language also indicates the ticket would remain open for a week unless the customer responded, which reduces the risk of premature closure.",
    "evidence": [
      "As requested, please find the license attached.",
      "This ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal."

  "P1_SEV1_MISHANDLING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No P1/SEV1/critical outage or all-users-down impact is described. The request is a standard license transfer/issuance with a target date, not an explicit production outage requiring emergency handling.",
    "evidence": [
      "G2-2023 Standard 32bit License request\nPlease issue it by January 7, 2026."
