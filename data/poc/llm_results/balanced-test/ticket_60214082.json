    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI did not provide demonstrably incorrect technical guidance, and there is no customer complaint about accuracy. While the AI shifted to license/support-eligibility gating rather than troubleshooting, this could be a standard intake step rather than a clear quality failure based on the limited, truncated log.",
    "evidence": [
      "we recently updated mailessentials from 22.1 to 22.2 . our multi-server setup is not working now. im unable to set the slave server",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer requested a human/technician, expressed frustration about the AI, or encountered repeated looping responses. The available conversation shows only an initial issue statement and the AI\u2019s first gating step.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI did not ask the customer to repeat information that was already provided, nor did it contradict a stated troubleshooting step. The AI\u2019s response did not directly address the upgrade/multi-server symptom yet, but this is not clear 'ignoring context' without further back-and-forth showing missed details.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No customer complaint about waiting is shown, and the ticket lifecycle (created and closed within ~2 hours) does not indicate a >24h response delay pattern. There is also no agent apology for delays in the provided content.",

    "reasoning": "The ticket is marked closed, but the interaction transcript is truncated and does not show the final customer message or any confirmation of resolution. Without seeing that the customer\u2019s last message indicated the issue was still unresolved at the time of closure, premature closure cannot be concluded.",

    "reasoning": "The customer reports a multi-server setup issue after an upgrade, but the ticket does not explicitly indicate P1/SEV1/critical severity, full outage, or urgency language. With no explicit severity and no evidence of delayed response beyond critical thresholds, mishandling is not supported.",
