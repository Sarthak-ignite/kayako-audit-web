The customer also indicated they expected a human follow-up per what the AI communicated, but instead kept receiving AI/automated responses. This is a clear, customer-confirmed quality failure in usefulness and expectation-setting.",

There is a clear pattern of the customer re-contacting support over days/weeks with \u201cstill waiting\u201d messages, indicating a loop with no progress and no effective handoff.",

    "reasoning": "Support (via AI) continued to push steps and framing that the customer said were already done, and initially referenced whitelist/blocklist guidance even after the customer clarified the affected page was Information Store Protection.
