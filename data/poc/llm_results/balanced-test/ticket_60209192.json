{
  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The agent asked reasonable clarifying questions (error details, screenshot) and provided a relevant knowledge-base article. There is no clear evidence of incorrect information, broken promises, or the response being unhelpful relative to the limited problem description provided by the customer.",
    "evidence": [
      "Could you please let us know what error you are getting while creating a location? Kindly send us a screenshot of the error and the fields that you have filled while creating a location.",
      "In case you are facing issues validating address, please follow the steps from the article Creating Locations ... which includes a workaround."

  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer asked for a human/escalation, expressed frustration about AI, or experienced repetitive looping responses. The ticket shows only one substantive support reply.",
    "evidence": [
      "I am having an issue creating new locations"
    ]
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer did not provide error text, screenshots, or detailed steps, so the agent\u2019s request for those details is a reasonable clarification rather than ignoring previously provided context. No repeated requests for already-supplied information are shown.",
    "evidence": [
      "I am having an issue creating new locations",
      "Could you please let us know what error you are getting while creating a location?"

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The first substantive agent response occurred within approximately 17 hours of the customer describing the issue, which is under the 24-hour threshold given in the rubric. The customer also did not complain about waiting, and the agent did not apologize for delays.",
    "evidence": [
      "[2025-09-29T14:02:55+00:00] ... I am having an issue creating new locations",
      "[2025-09-30T06:53:48+00:00] ... Dear Anthony, Thank you for your patience."

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the customer\u2019s last message indicates an unresolved issue, the thread shows no further customer engagement after the agent requested diagnostic details and warned about auto-closing after one week. Without evidence that the customer was still actively engaging or that support closed it while an active back-and-forth was ongoing, this is not clearly a premature closure under the balanced standard.",
    "evidence": [
      "This ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.",
      "I am having an issue creating new locations"

  "P1_SEV1_MISHANDLING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no indication the issue was marked or described as P1/SEV1, critical, outage, or affecting all users. The customer reported a functional problem but did not communicate urgency at a level requiring P1 handling.",
