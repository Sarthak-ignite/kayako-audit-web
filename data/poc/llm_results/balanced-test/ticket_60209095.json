    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The visible AI content (ATLAS transcript) provides generic troubleshooting questions and plausible causes (e.g., naming, scale, data availability). There is no clear, ticket-contradicted misinformation, no broken AI promise, and no customer complaint about AI accuracy/quality.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer repeatedly followed up due to lack of response, but they did not complain about being stuck with AI or request a human because of AI. The later conversation is clearly handled by human agents and engineering escalation rather than an AI loop.",

Therefore, it cannot be confidently flagged as P1/SEV1 mishandling under the balanced standard.",
