  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no agent/AI reply shown in the interaction log, so there is no AI-provided information to evaluate for correctness or helpfulness.",

  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No evidence of an AI \u201cwall\u201d or looping behavior appears because the ticket shows only a customer message and no back-and-forth responses. The customer did express frustration about lack of reply, but not specifically about AI or repeated automated responses.",
    "evidence": [
      "We had tried to reach out a few times now without a reply."
    ]
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no support response asking for already-provided information or steering troubleshooting against stated facts. With only the customer message visible, ignoring-context behavior cannot be evidenced.",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly states they have attempted to reach support multiple times without receiving a reply, indicating a perceived response delay. This is clear, direct evidence from the customer.",
    "evidence": [
      "We had tried to reach out a few times now without a reply.",
      "Usually when this happens, it means our products is not a priority right now."

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket was closed immediately even though the customer's last message was a live request for engagement/clarification, not a resolution confirmation. Closing at essentially the same time as ticket creation strongly suggests closure without addressing the customer\u2019s questions.",
    "evidence": [
      "Is it safe for me to assume that\u2032s the case here?",
      "If you\u2032d rather we follow up in the future when you have more bandwidth, we are happy to do that as well.",

    "detected": false,
