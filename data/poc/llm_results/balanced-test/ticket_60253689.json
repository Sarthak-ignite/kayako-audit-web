  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no AI response in the ticket transcript, and no customer complaint about incorrect or unhelpful AI guidance. The only customer-visible content is an unsubscribe instruction, not an AI-generated support answer to a question.",

      "Aven Saren commented publicly: To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to support+unsubscribe@khoros.com."

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer asked for a human/technician or expressed frustration with automated/AI help. The interaction does not show repetitive responses or a back-and-forth loop.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did not ask the customer to repeat information or pursue troubleshooting that the customer had already ruled out. The agent only performed an administrative closure with no follow-up questions shown.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the ticket was closed quickly, the last customer message does not clearly request help or indicate an unresolved issue; it reads like an informational unsubscribe instruction. Without a clear open question/problem from the customer, there is insufficient evidence to call this premature closure.",
