    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no visible AI-generated support guidance or troubleshooting in the provided interactions\u2014only internal ticket notes and IVR call transcript. Without any AI answer to evaluate, there is no clear evidence of incorrect or unhelpful AI output.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No customer messages show requests for a human/technician, frustration with AI, or repeated AI replies. The only repetition present is the phone IVR repeating menu options, which is not evidence of an AI support chat loop.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket content does not include an actual support dialogue or troubleshooting exchange where support asked for already-provided details. Since the ticket is explicitly for logging and the conversation is not present, there is no clear evidence that support ignored customer-provided context.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no explicit customer complaint about waiting, no agent apology for delays, and no visible back-and-forth showing the customer was awaiting a response. The ticket was marked solved almost immediately after creation in the metadata, so there is no clear evidence of response delay impacting the customer.",
