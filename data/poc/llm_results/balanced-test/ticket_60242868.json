    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer reported a specific functional issue (log/protocol not responding to filter inputs and a 404 on \u201cDetails\u201d), but the AI response pivoted to license verification without addressing the reported symptoms or starting relevant troubleshooting. This is clearly unhelpful relative to the question/problem stated.",

      "Das Protokoll ist gest\u00f6rt. Es reagiert nicht mehr auf Filtereingaben. Beim Klick auf \"Details\" erscheint \"404 not found\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer asked for a human/escalation, expressed frustration with AI, or that the AI repeated the same guidance multiple times in a loop (the visible excerpt shows only one problem statement and one AI follow-up).",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the AI did not engage with the technical details provided, there is not enough visible conversation to show it repeatedly asked for already-provided information or forced the customer to restate details multiple times. A single (even if unhelpful) license-verification question is not, by itself, a clear \u2018ignoring context\u2019 pattern under a balanced standard.",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the ticket ended in a closed state, the provided interaction excerpt is truncated and does not show the later messages leading to resolution/closure.
