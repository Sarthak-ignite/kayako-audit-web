    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the IVR menu repeats, there is no evidence the customer requested a human/technician, expressed frustration, or experienced repetitive AI chat responses. The repetition shown appears to be a phone keypad input validation loop, not an AI support loop.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The visible content does not include any customer request for help or indication of an unresolved issue at the time of closure.
