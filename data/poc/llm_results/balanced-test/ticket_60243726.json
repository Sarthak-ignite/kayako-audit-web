  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI interactions were noticeably unhelpful for the customer\u2019s request (vendor due diligence documents). ATLAS first asked for logs/screenshots (irrelevant to a documentation request) and later asked for document names in a way that did not advance the request, while the real action needed was internal coordination with compliance/BizOps.",
    "evidence": [
      "If you have any \ud83d\udcc3 log files or \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f screenshots to upload to help with the troubleshooting, now is the time to do it \ud83d\udcaa",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is repetition (ATLAS posted essentially the same request twice on 2025-12-03), but it does not reach a clear 3+ looping pattern, and the customer did not explicitly request a human or express clear frustration with the AI. The customer\u2019s follow-ups appear to be about waiting for an update rather than complaining about an AI loop.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support asked for clarification on the exact documents needed, and while the customer initially requested broad categories (financial report, cyber/data security policies), they had not provided the specific document list until 2025-12-08. The clarification request is therefore not clearly asking for information already provided.",
    "evidence": [
      "We need GFI FaxMaker's financial report, Cyber and Data security policies and any other vendor due diligence they provide.",
      "could you kindly clarify the name of the specific document(s) you require for your due diligence?"

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer waited a long time for progress and had to follow up multiple times before receiving a meaningful public response. An agent explicitly apologized for the delay, which is clear evidence that response/update timing was an issue in this ticket.",
    "evidence": [
      "[2025-11-18] I am just checking in for an update on this ticket.",
      "[2025-11-24] Just checking in for an update on this ticket.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "This was a vendor due diligence/documentation request and was not marked as P1/SEV1, nor did it describe an outage or critical service impact requiring emergency handling.",

      "My company is preforming their vendor due diligence. We need GFI FaxMaker's financial report, Cyber and Data security policies and any other vendor due diligence they provide."
