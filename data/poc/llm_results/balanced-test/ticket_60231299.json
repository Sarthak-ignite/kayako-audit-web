  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer reported a certificate problem on a GFI-managed redirect endpoint and asked support to fix it quickly. The agent response is largely generic and shifts toward client-side bypass advice and customer-managed certificate checks, without clearly acknowledging ownership of the central endpoint issue or stating that it will be escalated/fixed. This is materially unhelpful relative to the specific request (fix the redirects.gfikerioconnect.com certificate).",
    "evidence": [
      "today the certificate for https://redirects.gfikerioconnect.com/ has expired or changed? This leads to a security message for users of the Kerio Connect Desktop Mail Client:",
      "please fix this quickly!",
      "While the knowledge base article \"The security certificate for the server is invalid or expired\" When Setting up Email on Spark [...] describes how a similar message appears in client applications and can sometimes be bypassed",
      "In the meantime, you may advise your users that this warning arises from an expired or untrusted certificate...",
      "If using your own Kerio Connect installation, periodically reviewing and renewing SSL certificates..."

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The agent does acknowledge the specific URL and the possibility of a central redirection endpoint certificate issue. While parts of the reply are generic, there is not clear evidence of asking for already-provided information or directly contradicting the customer\u2019s stated scenario.",
    "evidence": [
      "Thank you for bringing to our attention the issue regarding the expired or changed certificate at https://redirects.gfikerioconnect.com/",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
