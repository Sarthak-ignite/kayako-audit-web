{
  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI responses are generic but not demonstrably incorrect or contradicted by ticket facts. The guidance (browser/cache, multiple protected resources, proxies/VPN, session timeouts) is plausible for repeated HTTP Basic Auth prompts, and the customer did not complain about AI accuracy.",
    "evidence": [
      "This type of issue is likely related to basic authentication in staging environments.",
      "repeated login prompts can occur due to several factors, including: Browser Session/Cache Issues ... Multiple Page Resources ... Network or Proxy Settings ... Session Timeout Settings"
    ]
  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear pattern of the customer repeatedly re-engaging without progress, nor a request for a human/technician. While ATLAS posted two similar replies close together, it does not meet the 3+ repetitive-loop threshold and the customer did not express frustration about AI support itself.",
    "evidence": [
      "[2025-11-25T11:31:28+00:00] ... ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Sheena, Thank you for reaching out ...",
      "[2025-11-25T11:32:25+00:00] ... ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Sheena, Thank you for reaching out ..."
    ]
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did not clearly ask for information already provided, and after the customer ruled out incognito/cookies/single-user causes, there is no subsequent support message shown that repeats those same steps or ignores the update. The ticket moves to internal tracking (JIRA) rather than continuing redundant troubleshooting.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: ... it often requests the same login details over and over again, even though they are entered correctly.",
      "Customer: Hi, the same issue occurs using incognito mode, cookies are enabled, and confirmed that multiple users are experiencing the same issue, all with different devices and connections."
    ]
  },
  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The initial response appears to be within a few minutes of ticket creation, and the customer does not complain about slow responses or waiting. Later activity is mostly internal hold/JIRA updates rather than customer-visible waiting with follow-up pings.",
    "evidence": [
      "Ticket Created: 2025-11-25 11:29:00",
      "[2025-11-25T11:31:28+00:00] ... ATLAS commented publicly ..."
    ]
  },
  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket is placed on hold and linked to a JIRA issue; there is no evidence the ticket was closed while the customer indicated the issue was unresolved. No closure message is present in the transcript.",
    "evidence": [
      "Status: hold",
      "[2025-12-01T04:38:30+00:00] ... Placing on hold for 9999 hour(s)"
    ]
  },
  "P1_SEV1_MISHANDLING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer describes significant frustration and intermittent inability to access stage, but the ticket is not explicitly labeled P1/SEV1/critical/outage. Support responded quickly with relevant troubleshooting and then opened an engineering JIRA, which does not clearly indicate mishandling of a declared critical incident.",
    "evidence": [
      "It's very frustrating when it won't load the page without requesting the details over and over, as it can continue requesting details for up to 1 hour at times.",
      "SaaS Jira - issue key AURORA-840 // Issue is created ... Problem:Dropbox stage community ... intermittently unusable because the HTTP Basic Auth (HTAccess) prompt keeps re-appearing"
