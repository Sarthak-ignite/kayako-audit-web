    "reasoning": "The AI response is generic, but it is not demonstrably incorrect and it does provide a relevant next step (the status page) while indicating an active incident. The requested RCA was ultimately delivered later in the ticket, so there is no clear broken promise or proven misinformation attributable to the AI.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support does not repeatedly ask for information already provided, and the AI/agent correctly references the instance URL and the reported disruption context. There is no clear sign the customer had to restate details or that support pursued a path already ruled out.",

    "reasoning": "The structured data shows an initial response time of 22 (which is not >24 hours), and the conversation contains no customer complaint about waiting.

The request is primarily for an RCA, and support did respond quickly with a status-page reference and later delivered the RCA.",
