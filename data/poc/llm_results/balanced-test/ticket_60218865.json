    "reasoning": "The customer\u2019s request was to change the fault/ticket priority to High, but the AI\u2019s visible response pivots to license-key information instead of addressing how to change priority or confirming it was updated. With the limited transcript available (truncated), the response shown is not aligned to the customer\u2019s stated need and would likely be considered unhelpful by a reviewer.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI response appears off-target, but there isn\u2019t clear evidence of the AI asking the customer to repeat already-provided information or contradicting steps the customer said they already tried.
