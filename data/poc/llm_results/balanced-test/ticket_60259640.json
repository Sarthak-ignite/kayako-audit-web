    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI interaction shown is limited to basic intake questions (priority and instance URL selection). There is no demonstrably incorrect guidance, no unmet promise, and no customer complaint about AI quality in the provided content.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer asked for a human/escalation, expressed frustration, or encountered repeated looping responses. The conversation is very short and does not show repeated cycles.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No instance of support re-asking for information the customer already clearly provided is present. The AI asked for priority and then for instance selection, which is a reasonable next step given the limited information shown.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket appears to have been solved/closed immediately after an intake-style AI prompt asking the customer to select/provide an instance URL, with no evidence the customer answered or that the issue was addressed. Closing at that point would reasonably be flagged as premature because the intake process was not completed and no resolution is documented in the interaction shown.",
