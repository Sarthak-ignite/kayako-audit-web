There is no visible incorrect guidance, broken promise, or customer complaint about AI quality in the provided text (the key part of the AI response is also truncated).",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer asked for a human/technician, expressed frustration, or that the AI repeated the same instructions multiple times. The interaction shown is too brief to indicate looping behavior.",
