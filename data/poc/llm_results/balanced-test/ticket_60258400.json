  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI responses were generic and heavily KB-driven, but there is no clear evidence they were factually wrong or that the AI made/failed explicit promises. The customer\u2019s feedback indicates repetition rather than incorrectness.",

      "Those steps are basically what was recommended in articles before."

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is a clear loop where the customer asks for log review, but support keeps sending similar KB steps and requesting logs again. The customer explicitly pushes for a human to look at the logs due to urgency, indicating the AI-style loop was not moving the case forward.",
    "evidence": [
      "Those steps are basically what was recommended in articles before.",
      "Please have someone look at the logs, otherwise, there's a high risk of losing the customer's renewal, which is in two weeks.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer stated they already followed the recommended articles and provided server/agent logs, but support continued to recommend the same article-driven steps and asked for agent logs again. This shows support did not sufficiently incorporate information already provided in the ticket.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The structured context shows an initial response time of 56 (appears to be minutes), which does not indicate a >24h delay. The customer also does not explicitly complain about slow response times.",

    "detected": true,

The agent message also indicates an auto-close process (\u201cstay open for one week...\u201d), which increases the likelihood it was closed without confirmed resolution.",
