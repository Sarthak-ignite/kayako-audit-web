    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS provided broadly reasonable initial troubleshooting steps (status page check, browser isolation, simplifying filters) and did not state anything demonstrably false or make specific promises that were later broken. The guidance is somewhat generic, but that alone is not enough to flag as a clear AI quality failure under a balanced standard.",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cAccording to our knowledge base article on FogBugz On-Demand performance issues... this type of error generally indicates a temporary issue on the server side or a problem processing particular filter queries.\u201d",

    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly pushed back on the AI flow and indicated they want an agent to handle it rather than being asked for more information by the bot.

    "reasoning": "ATLAS requested information that had already been provided in the ticket intake (timing, trigger/action, scope, and environment).
