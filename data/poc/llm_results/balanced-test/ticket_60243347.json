    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer asked a specific product/API question, but the AI did not attempt to answer or provide relevant documentation/API endpoints. Instead, it pivoted to requesting logs/screenshots, which is not a helpful or appropriate next step for an API capability inquiry. This would reasonably be flagged as unhelpful handling of the question asked.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer requested a human/technician or expressed frustration, and there is no pattern of repetitive AI messages (3+ similar loops). The conversation shown is too short to establish looping.",

  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI did not explicitly ask the customer to repeat information they already provided, and there is no back-and-forth showing the customer having to restate details. While the AI response is arguably irrelevant, that aligns more with an AI quality/unhelpfulness issue than clear evidence of ignoring previously provided context.",

    "reasoning": "The ticket was closed without any visible answer to the customer\u2019s API question or confirmation that the issue was resolved.
