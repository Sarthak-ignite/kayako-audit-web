  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no customer-facing AI response in the transcript to evaluate for correctness or helpfulness. The only AI entries are internal/private notes and hold actions, and the customer did not complain about AI accuracy or behavior.",
    "evidence": [
      "Centralsupport-ai-acc commented privately: The customer (Antonio Orellano) is requesting additional information about migrating their instance to the cloud.",
      "Centralsupport-ai-acc commented privately: Placing on hold for 48 hour(s)"
    ]
  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer did not request a human or complain about interacting with AI, and there is no pattern of repetitive AI replies to the customer. The thread shows a normal escalation to an internal stakeholder (Product VP) rather than an AI loop.",

    "detected": false,

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The initial response time and the visible timeline show the customer waited multiple days before receiving a public update. The customer explicitly followed up, and the agent apologized for the wait, indicating a delay that a quality reviewer would likely flag.",
    "evidence": [
      "initialResponseTime: 85485",
      "Customer (2025-11-25T22:24:20+00:00): Hello Hermes, Would like to follow-up this request.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer\u2019s request was for detailed information about the migration process, support assistance, and potential professional service costs, but the final response primarily redirects to Sales and then closes the ticket without providing those details. The customer did not confirm resolution before closure, so this may be viewed as closing while the request remained unanswered by Support.",
    "evidence": [
      "Centralsupport-ai-acc commented privately: he wants to understand what the migration process involves, what type of assistance we can provide during the migration, and whether there are any associated professional service costs.",
